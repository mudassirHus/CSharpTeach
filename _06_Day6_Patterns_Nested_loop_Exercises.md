# Standard Pattern Printing Exercises

## 📌 Instructions

👉 Follow these guidelines while solving the patterns:
- Use `Console.WriteLine()` for output
- Practice using:
  - Single loops
  - Nested loops
- Do not use built-in pattern shortcuts
- Focus on understanding **rows, columns, and spacing**
- One program per question
- Maintain proper formatting and alignment

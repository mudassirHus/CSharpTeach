# Day 8: Strings in C# (Complete Beginner Guide)

Strings are used to **store and work with text** in a program.

In simple words:
If your data is **text** (name, message, sentence) → use **string**.

---

## 1. What is a String?

A **string** is a sequence of characters enclosed in **double quotes**.

Example:

```csharp
string name = "Ammaar";
```

> In C#, `string` is a **reference type** but behaves like a value type because it is **immutable**.

---

## 2. Why do we need Strings?

Strings are used to:

* Store names, messages, input text
* Display output to users
* Perform text operations (search, replace, compare)

---

## 3. Creating Strings in C#

### 1️⃣ Using string literal (most common)

```csharp
string s1 = "Hello";
```

### 2️⃣ Using `new` keyword

```csharp
string s2 = new string('A', 3); // "AAA"
```

---

## 4. String Immutability (Very Important)

Strings in C# are **immutable**, meaning:

> Once a string is created, it **cannot be changed**.

Example:

```csharp
string s = "Hello";
s = s + " World";
```

👉 A **new string object** is created in memory.

---

## 5. How Strings are Stored in Memory

* String objects are stored in **heap memory**
* Reference is stored in **stack memory**
* C# uses **String Intern Pool** for optimization

Example:

```csharp
string a = "Hi";
string b = "Hi";
```

👉 Both `a` and `b` point to the **same memory location**.

---

## 6. String Intern Pool

* Stores **unique string literals**
* Improves memory efficiency
* Same literal → same reference

---

## 7. String Length

```csharp
string msg = "Hello";
Console.WriteLine(msg.Length); // 5
```

---

## 8. Accessing Characters in String

```csharp
string word = "CSharp";
Console.WriteLine(word[0]); // C
```

---

## 9. String Comparison

### Using `==` 
It is used to check the **memory address** of the string objects.
```csharp
string a = "Hi";
string b = "Hi";
Console.WriteLine(a == b); // true
```

### Using `Equals()`
It is used to check the **content** of the string objects.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(a.Equals(b)); // true
```

---

## 10. Escape Sequences in Strings

| Escape | Meaning      |
| ------ | ------------ |
| \n     | New line     |
| \t     | Tab          |
| \"     | Double quote |
| \      | Backslash    |
| '      | Single quote |

---

## 11. Verbatim Strings (@)

Used to ignore escape characters.

```csharp
string path = @"C:\Users\Admin\Desktop";
```

---

## 12. String Interpolation

```csharp
string name = "Ammaar";
int age = 22;

Console.WriteLine($"Name: {name}, Age: {age}");
```

---

## 13. foreach with String

```csharp
string text = "ABC";

foreach(char c in text)
{
    Console.WriteLine(c);
}
```

---

## 14. Common Beginner Mistakes

* Assuming strings are mutable
* Using `==` without understanding
* Forgetting escape characters
* Heavy concatenation using `+`

---

## 15. String vs char Array

| Feature     | string    | char[]   |
| ----------- | --------- | -------- |
| Mutable     | ❌ No      | ✅ Yes    |
| Ease of use | Easy      | Moderate |
| Performance | Optimized | Manual   |

---

## 16. StringBuilder and StringBuffer

### What is StringBuilder?

`StringBuilder` is a **mutable** class used to create and modify strings **without creating new objects**.

In simple words:

> If you need **many string modifications** → use `StringBuilder`.

Example:

```csharp
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
sb.Append(" World");
Console.WriteLine(sb);
```

---

### What is StringBuffer?

👉 **Important (C# clarity):**

* `StringBuffer` exists in **Java**, NOT in C# ❌
* In **C#**, the equivalent thread-safe option is **StringBuilder with synchronization**

So in C#:

* `StringBuilder` → used for performance
* Thread safety is handled differently

---

## 17. string vs StringBuilder (Very Important)

| Feature     | string                 | StringBuilder       |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Mutable     | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes               |
| Memory      | New object each change | Same object         |
| Performance | Slow for many changes  | Fast                |
| Thread-safe | Yes (immutable)        | No                  |
| Use case    | Read-only text         | Heavy modifications |

---

### Example Comparison

#### Using string ❌

```csharp
string s = "";
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    s += i;
}
```

Creates **multiple objects** in memory.

---

#### Using StringBuilder ✅

```csharp
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    sb.Append(i);
}
```

Efficient and memory-friendly.

---

## 18. When to Use What?

* Use `string` when:

  * Text is fixed
  * Few or no modifications

* Use `StringBuilder` when:

  * Frequent concatenation
  * Loops modifying strings

---

## 19. Interview Tips (Strings)

> Q: Why StringBuilder is faster than string?

Answer:
"Because StringBuilder is mutable and does not create new objects for every modification, unlike string."

> Q: Are strings mutable in C#?

Answer:
"No, strings are immutable. Any modification creates a new string object."

---

## Key Takeaways

* String stores text data
* Strings are immutable
* Stored in heap memory
* String pool optimizes memory
* Use string interpolation for clean code

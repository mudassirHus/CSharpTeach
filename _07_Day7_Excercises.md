# C# Array Practice – 25 Progressive Problems

## 📌 Instructions

👉 Follow these rules while solving the problems:
- Use arrays (`int[]`, `int[,]`)
- Use loops (`for`, `while`, `foreach`) as required
- Use conditional statements where needed
- Use `Console.ReadLine()` for input
- Use `Console.WriteLine()` for output
- ❌ Avoid using LINQ or built-in helper methods unless explicitly stated
- Write one program per problem
- Focus on logic, clarity, and step-by-step thinking

## Phase 1: Very Basic 1D Array

1. Print all elements of an array.  
2. Print array elements in reverse order.  
3. Find the sum of all elements.  
4. Count elements without using `Length`.  
5. Find the maximum element.  
6. Find the minimum element.  
7. Count even numbers in the array.  
8. Replace all negative numbers with zero.

## Phase 2: Logical 1D Array Problems

9. Search for a given element in the array.  
10. Count occurrences of a given number.  
11. Copy elements from one array to another.  
12. Reverse the array in-place.  
13. Find the second largest element.  
14. Check if the array is sorted in ascending order.  
15. Shift elements to the left by one position.

## Phase 3: Pattern and Frequency Thinking

16. Print unique elements from the array.  
17. Find the frequency of each element.  
18. Find the missing number from 1 to N.  
19. Find all pairs whose sum equals a given number.

## Phase 4: 2D Array Problems

20. Print a 2D array row by row.  
21. Find the sum of all elements in a 2D array.  
22. Find row-wise sum.  
23. Find column-wise sum.  
24. Find the largest element in a 2D array.  
25. Find primary and secondary diagonal sums.

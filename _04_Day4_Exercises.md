# C# Looping Statements – Practice Problems

## 📌 Instruction

👉 Solve **each problem using all three loops**:
- `for`
- `while`
- `do-while`

This will help you clearly understand the differences, behavior, and use cases of each loop.

---

## Rules

- Use `Console.ReadLine()` for input.
- Use `Console.WriteLine()` for output.
- Use looping statements only:
  - `for`
  - `while`
  - `do-while`
- Use conditions where required.
- Do **not** use arrays or collections.
- Write clean and readable code.
- One program per problem.

# C# String Practice – 25 Progressive Problems

## 📌 Instructions

👉 Follow these rules while solving the problems:
- Work at the **character level first**
- Use loops (`for`, `while`, `foreach`) where required
- Use conditional statements as needed
- Use `Console.ReadLine()` for input
- Use `Console.WriteLine()` or  `Console.Write()` for output
- ❌ Avoid built-in helpers like:
  - `Split`
  - `Replace`
  - `IndexOf`
  - `Regex`
  - `LINQ`
- Write one program per problem
- Focus on logic, clarity, and step-by-step thinking

## Phase 1: Very Basic String Handling

1. Print each character of a string on a new line.  
2. Count total characters without using `Length`.  
3. Print the string in reverse order.  
4. Count vowels in the string.  
5. Count numeric characters in the string.  
6. Count spaces in the string.  
7. Convert lowercase letters to uppercase manually.

## Phase 2: Logical String Problems

8. Check whether a string is a palindrome.  
9. Count occurrences of a given character.  
10. Replace all occurrences of one character with another manually.  
11. Remove all spaces from the string.  
12. Find the index of the first occurrence of a character.  
13. Find the index of the last occurrence of a character.

## Phase 3: Pattern and Frequency Thinking

14. Print frequency of each character in the string.  
15. Remove duplicate characters while keeping order.  
16. Count words in a sentence.  
17. Reverse each word while keeping word order.  
18. Find the longest word in a sentence.

## Phase 4: Realistic String Processing

19. Check whether two strings are anagrams.  
20. Capitalize the first letter of each word.  
21. Compress the string using character counts  
    (Example: `aaaab → a4b1`).  
22. Validate a variable name identifier.  
23. Extract all numbers from a mixed string.

## Phase 5: Parser Thinking

24. Find the most frequent word in a paragraph.  
25. Validate an email address using simple rules.

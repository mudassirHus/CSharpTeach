# Day 4: Loops in C#

Loops are used to **repeat a block of code multiple times**.  
They help us avoid writing the same code again and again.

In simple words:  
Repeat something **until a condition becomes false**

---

## 1. What is a Loop?

A **loop** is a programming construct that executes a block of code **repeatedly** based on a condition.

> The condition always returns **true** or **false**  
> The loop runs while the condition is **true** and stops when it becomes **false**

---

## 2. Why Do We Need Loops?

Loops are important because they:
- 🔁 Avoid repeating the same code
- ⏱ Save time and effort
- 🧠 Improve logical thinking
- 📊 Help process numbers and data
- 🧹 Keep programs clean and readable

Without loops, programs become long, repetitive, and hard to maintain.

## 3. for Loop

### Definition:
The `for` loop is used when you **know in advance** how many times the loop should run.

---

### Syntax:
```csharp
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
{
    // code to repeat
}
Flow of Execution:
Initialization runs once

Condition is checked

If condition is true, loop body executes

Increment/Decrement updates the value

Condition is checked again

When condition becomes false, loop stops

Example:
csharp
Copy code
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
4. while Loop
Definition:
The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not fixed and depends only on a condition.

Syntax:
csharp
Copy code
while (condition)
{
    // code to repeat
}
Flow of Execution:
Condition is checked before entering the loop

If condition is true, loop body executes

Value is updated inside the loop

Condition is checked again

Loop stops when condition becomes false

⚠️ If the condition is false initially, the loop will not execute even once.

Example:
csharp
Copy code
int i = 1;

while (i <= 3)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
    i++;
}
5. do-while Loop
Definition:
The do-while loop is used when the loop body must execute at least once, even if the condition is false.

Syntax:
csharp
Copy code
do
{
    // code to repeat
}
while (condition);
Flow of Execution:
Loop body executes first

Condition is checked after execution

If condition is true, loop repeats

If condition is false, loop stops

✅ Guaranteed minimum one execution

Example:
csharp
Copy code
int i = 5;

do
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
    i++;
}
while (i <= 3);
6. Loop Control Statements
break
Used to stop the loop immediately.

csharp
Copy code
if (i == 3)
{
    break;
}
continue
Used to skip the current iteration.

csharp
Copy code
if (i == 3)
{
    continue;
}
7. Comparison of Loops
Loop	Condition Check	Minimum Runs
for	Before loop	0
while	Before loop	0
do-while	After loop	1

8. Common Beginner Mistakes
Forgetting to update loop variable

Creating infinite loops

Using wrong condition (< vs <=)

Confusing while and do-while

Writing too much logic inside loops

Key Takeaways
Loops are used to repeat tasks

for → fixed number of repetitions

while → condition-based repetition

do-while → runs at least once

Loop condition controls execution

Understanding flow is more important than syntax

🎯 GOAL (Must Read 💪)
👉 Build patience by understanding loop flow, not memorizing code 🧠
👉 Always dry-run your loops line by line ✍️
👉 Ask yourself:

Where does the loop start?

When does it stop?

What changes in every iteration?

👉 Practice simple loops daily
👉 Move to nested loops slowly 🔁

⏳ Be patient — loops train discipline
🚀 Master loops, and programming becomes easier

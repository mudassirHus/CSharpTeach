title: "Loops in C#"

description: |
  Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.
  They help us avoid writing the same code again and again.

  In simple words:
  Repeat something until a condition becomes false.

sections:

  - section: "What is a Loop?"
    content: |
      A loop is a programming construct that executes a block of code repeatedly
      based on a condition.

      The loop continues while the condition is true.
      It stops when the condition becomes false.

  - section: "Why Do We Need Loops?"
    content: |
      Loops are important because they:
      - Avoid repeating the same code
      - Save time and effort
      - Improve logical thinking
      - Help work with numbers, arrays, and data
      - Keep programs clean and readable

      Without loops, programs become long, messy, and hard to maintain.

  - section: "for Loop"
    definition: |
      The for loop is used when you know in advance
      how many times the loop should run.
    syntax: |
      for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
      {
          // code to repeat
      }
    flow: |
      1. Initialization runs once
      2. Condition is checked
      3. If condition is true, loop body executes
      4. Increment/Decrement updates the value
      5. Condition is checked again
      6. When condition becomes false, loop stops
    example: |
      for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
      {
          Console.WriteLine(i);
      }
    execution_flow: |
      i = 1 → true → print 1
      i = 2 → true → print 2
      i = 3 → true → print 3
      i = 4 → false → exit loop

  - section: "while Loop"
    definition: |
      The while loop is used when the number of iterations
      is not fixed and depends on a condition.
    syntax: |
      while (condition)
      {
          // code to repeat
      }
    flow: |
      1. Condition is checked before entering the loop
      2. If condition is true, loop body executes
      3. Value is updated inside the loop
      4. Condition is checked again
      5. When condition becomes false, loop stops

      Note: If the condition is false initially,
      the loop will not execute even once.
    example: |
      int i = 1;

      while (i <= 3)
      {
          Console.WriteLine(i);
          i++;
      }
    execution_flow: |
      i = 1 → true → print 1
      i = 2 → true → print 2
      i = 3 → true → print 3
      i = 4 → false → exit loop

  - section: "do-while Loop"
    definition: |
      The do-while loop is used when the loop body
      must execute at least once, even if the condition is false.
    syntax: |
      do
      {
          // code to repeat
      }
      while (condition);
    flow: |
      1. Loop body executes first
      2. Condition is checked after execution
      3. If condition is true, loop repeats
      4. If condition is false, loop stops

      Guaranteed minimum one execution.
    example: |
      int i = 5;

      do
      {
          Console.WriteLine(i);
          i++;
      }
      while (i <= 3);
    execution_flow: |
      Print 5 (runs once)
      Condition checked → false
      Loop exits

  - section: "Loop Control Statements"
    break: |
      Used to stop the loop immediately.
      Example:
      if (i == 3)
      {
          break;
      }
    continue: |
      Used to skip the current iteration.
      Example:
      if (i == 3)
      {
          continue;
      }

  - section: "Comparison of Loops"
    table: |
      for       -> condition checked before loop, minimum runs: 0
      while     -> condition checked before loop, minimum runs: 0
      do-while  -> condition checked after loop, minimum runs: 1

  - section: "Common Beginner Mistakes"
    points:
      - Forgetting to update loop variable
      - Creating infinite loops
      - Using wrong condition (< vs <=)
      - Confusing while and do-while
      - Writing too much logic inside loops

  - section: "Key Takeaways"
    content: |
      - Loops are used to repeat tasks
      - for is used for fixed repetitions
      - while is condition-based
      - do-while runs at least once
      - Understanding flow is more important than syntax

goal: |
  Build patience by understanding loop flow instead of memorizing code.
  Always dry-run loops line by line.

  Ask yourself:
  - Where does the loop start?
  - When does it stop?
  - What changes every iteration?

  Practice simple loops daily.
  Move to nested loops slowly.

  Be patient — loops train discipline.
  Master loops, and programming becomes easier.

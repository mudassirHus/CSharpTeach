# Day 2: Data Types & How Data Is Stored in Memory (C#)

Before learning data types in C#, we must understand **how data is stored inside computer memory**.

---

## 1. What Is Data?

In computer science, data can be broadly classified into:

1. **Numeric data** → numbers
2. **Text data** → characters and strings

Programming languages provide **data types** to store and work with this data efficiently.

---

## 2. What Is a Bit?

A **bit (binary digit)** is the **smallest unit of data** in a computer.

A bit can store **only one of two values**:

```
|0|  → OFF
|1|  → ON
```

So a single bit has **only two possible states**.

---

## 3. Binary to Decimal Conversion

Computers store numbers in **binary**, but humans read numbers in **decimal**.

Each bit represents a **power of 2**.

### Single Bit

| Binary | Calculation | Decimal |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| 0      | 0 × 2⁰      | 0       |
| 1      | 1 × 2⁰      | 1       |

➡️ With **1 bit**, the maximum value is **1**.

---

## 4. Why One Bit Is Not Enough

You **cannot store numbers like 2 or 3 using one bit**.

So we use **multiple bits**.

---

## 5. Using 2 Bits

| Binary | Calculation | Decimal |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| 00     | 0×2¹ + 0×2⁰ | 0       |
| 01     | 0×2¹ + 1×2⁰ | 1       |
| 10     | 1×2¹ + 0×2⁰ | 2       |
| 11     | 1×2¹ + 1×2⁰ | 3       |

➡️ With **2 bits**, the maximum value is **3**.

---

## 6. Leading Zeros Don’t Change Value

Just like:

```
0001234 == 1234 (decimal)
```

Similarly:

```
0000011 == 11 (binary) == 3 (decimal)
```

Leading zeros **do not change the value**.

---

## 7. Nibble (4 Bits)

A **nibble** = **4 bits**

Bit weights:

```
8   4   2   1
2³  2²  2¹  2⁰
```

| Binary | Decimal |
| ------ | ------- |
| 0000   | 0       |
| 0001   | 1       |
| 0010   | 2       |
| 0011   | 3       |
| 1111   | 15      |

➡️ Maximum value in 4 bits = **15**

---

## 8. How to Find Maximum Value for N Bits

**Rule:**
Fill all bits with `1` and convert to decimal.

### Example: 8 bits

```
11111111
= 2⁷ + 2⁶ + ... + 2⁰
= 255
```

➡️ **Unsigned 8-bit range:** `0 → 255`

---

## 9. Signed Numbers (Important Correction)

### ❌ Common misconception:

> “MSB is just a sign bit”

### ✅ Reality:

Computers use **Two’s Complement** to represent negative numbers.

* The **leftmost bit (MSB)** still *indicates* negativity
* But the value is **not calculated by simply ignoring it**
* This allows **efficient arithmetic** using the same hardware

---

### Signed 8-bit (Two’s Complement) Range

| Type          | Range          |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Unsigned byte | `0 to 255`     |
| Signed byte   | `-128 to +127` |

Why?

```
Total combinations = 256
Half for negatives, half for positives
```

---

## 10. Integer Data Types in C#

C# provides **signed and unsigned integer types**.

```csharp
byte a = 1;        // unsigned 8-bit
sbyte sb = -1;    // signed 8-bit

short s = -1;     // signed 16-bit
ushort us = 1;    // unsigned 16-bit

int i = -1;       // signed 32-bit
uint ui = 1;      // unsigned 32-bit

long l = -1;      // signed 64-bit
ulong ul = 1;     // unsigned 64-bit
```

### Size Information

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(sizeof(byte));    // 1
Console.WriteLine(sizeof(short));   // 2
Console.WriteLine(sizeof(int));     // 4
Console.WriteLine(sizeof(long));    // 8
```

---

## 11. Decimal (Floating-Point) Numbers

Used to store numbers with decimal points.

| Type    | Size     |
| ------- | -------- |
| float   | 4 bytes  |
| double  | 8 bytes  |
| decimal | 16 bytes |

```csharp
float f = 1.0f;
double d = 1.0;
decimal dc = 1.0m;
```

⚠️ `decimal` is slower but **more precise** (used in financial calculations).

---

## 12. Text Data Types

### `char`

* Stores **one character**
* Uses **Unicode**
* Size: **2 bytes** (not 1 — important correction)

```csharp
char c = 'a';
Console.WriteLine(sizeof(char)); // 2
```

### `string`

* Stores **multiple characters**
* Size depends on content
* `sizeof(string)` ❌ not allowed

```csharp
string str = "Hello";
```

---

## 13. Boolean Type

Used to represent **true or false**.

```csharp
bool b = true;
Console.WriteLine(sizeof(bool)); // 1 byte
```

---

## 14. Complete Example Program

```csharp
byte a = 1; // byte is only data type where by default its unsigned
sbyte sb = -1;

short s = -1;
ushort us = 1;

int i = -1;
uint ui = 1;

long l = -1;
ulong ul = 1;

float f = 1.0f;
double d = 1.0;
decimal dc = 1.0m;

char c = 'a';
string str = "Hello";

bool b = true;
```

## Key Takeaways

* Computers store everything in **binary**
* More bits → more values
* Signed integers use **Two’s Complement**
* Choose data types based on **range, precision, and memory**
* Understanding memory helps you write **efficient and correct programs**

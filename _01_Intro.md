## Difference between Visual Studio and VS Code

* **Visual Studio** is a full-fledged **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**.
  It provides everything needed to **write, debug, test, and develop applications** in one place.

* **VS Code** is a **lightweight code editor**.
  It is fast, extensible, and supports many languages through extensions, but it is **not a full IDE by default**.

* **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** — a complete environment that supports all stages of application development:
  writing code, building, debugging, testing, and deployment.

## What is a Framework?

A **framework** is a set of **rules, structures, tools, and runtime components** that provides a foundation for building and running applications.

---

## .NET Framework

The **.NET Framework** is a framework created by **Microsoft**.
It provides the structure, runtime engine, and libraries needed to run applications.

Using the .NET Framework, we can develop:

* Web applications

* Console applications

* Desktop/Windows applications

* Games

* First released in **2002 (version 1.0)**

* Latest version: **4.8.1 (2022)**

Web applications built on the .NET Framework run on **IIS (Internet Information Services)**, which is Microsoft’s web server.

## .NET Core and Modern .NET

In **2016**, Microsoft made the .NET platform **open-source and cross-platform**.

* **.NET Core 1.0 — 2016**

  * Introduced the **Kestrel web server**
  * Runs on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**
  * VS Code was also introduced as a cross-platform editor

* Visual Studio (full IDE) originally ran only on **Windows**
  (Modern versions also support macOS in limited editions)

Versions:

* .NET Core 2.0
* .NET Core 3.0 / 3.1
* **.NET 5, .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET 8** (Unified “.NET” platform)

---

## C# Versions (Examples)

C# has evolved across many versions:
**1.0, 2.0, 4.5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12…**

Each version introduced new language features.

---

## How .NET Executes Code

```
Application Code
------------------------------
CLR (Common Language Runtime)
```

Flow:

```
Application Code → IL (Intermediate Language) → CLR executes IL
```

Languages using CLR include:

* C#.NET
* F#.NET
* VB.NET
* (and other .NET-compatible languages)

---

## Understanding Visual Studio Project Structure

* **Solution** → contains one or more **Projects**
* **Project** → contains **.cs files (source code)** and other assets

---

## Useful Visual Studio Shortcuts

* **Ctrl + Shift + B** → Build Solution
* **F5** → Run with Debugging
* **Ctrl + F5** → Run without Debugging

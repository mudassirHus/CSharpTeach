# Day 4: Loops in Programming (for, while, do-while)

Loops are used to **repeat a block of code** multiple times until a condition becomes false.

In simple words:
If you want to do something again and again → **use a loop** 🔁

---

## 1. What is a Loop?

A **loop** is a control structure that allows the program to execute the same code repeatedly based on a condition.

> A loop continues running **while the condition is true**.

---

## 2. Why do we need Loops?

We use loops to:

* Reduce code repetition
* Save time and effort
* Work with series of numbers
* Handle large data easily

Example:
Printing numbers from 1 to 100 without loop = writing 100 lines ❌
With loop = 3 lines ✅

---

## 3. Types of Loops (We use these 3)

1. **for loop**
2. **while loop**
3. **do-while loop**

---

# 4. for Loop

### Definition:

The **for loop** is used when we know **how many times** we want to repeat.

### Syntax:

```java
for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
{
    // code to repeat
}
```

### Example:

```java
for(int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
{
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

### Trace (Dry Run):

| Step | i | i <= 3 | Print | i++ |
| ---- | - | ------ | ----- | --- |
| 1    | 1 | true   | 1     | 2   |
| 2    | 2 | true   | 2     | 3   |
| 3    | 3 | true   | 3     | 4   |
| 4    | 4 | false  | stop  |     |

### Explanation:

1. `int i = 1` → start
2. Check condition `i <= 3`
3. Print value
4. Increment i
5. Repeat until condition becomes false

Output:

```
1
2
3
```

# 5. while Loop

### Definition:

The **while loop** is used when repetition depends on a **condition**.

### Syntax:

```java
initialization;
while(condition)
{
    // code to repeat
    increment/decrement;
}
```

### Example:

```java
int i = 1;
while(i <= 3)
{
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

### Trace (Dry Run):

| Step | i | i <= 3 | Print | i++ |
| ---- | - | ------ | ----- | --- |
| 1    | 1 | true   | 1     | 2   |
| 2    | 2 | true   | 2     | 3   |
| 3    | 3 | true   | 3     | 4   |
| 4    | 4 | false  | stop  |     |

### Explanation:

* Condition is checked first
* If true → code runs
* After code, i is incremented
* Loop continues until condition becomes false

Output:

```
1
2
3
```

---

# 6. do-while Loop

### Definition:

The **do-while loop** runs **at least once**, even if the condition is false.

### Syntax:

```java
initialization;
do
{
    // code to repeat
    increment/decrement;
} while(condition);
```

### Example:

```java
int i = 1;
do
{
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while(i <= 3);
```

### Trace (Dry Run):

| Step | i | Print | i++ | i <= 3 |
| ---- | - | ----- | --- | ------ |
| 1    | 1 | 1     | 2   | true   |
| 2    | 2 | 2     | 3   | true   |
| 3    | 3 | 3     | 4   | false  |

### Explanation:

* Code executes first
* Then condition is checked
* Even if condition is false, loop runs once

Output:

```
1
2
3
```

## 7. Key Difference: while vs do-while

### while example:

```java
int i = 5;
while(i < 3)
{
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

Output: **No output** (condition false, loop not entered)

---

### do-while example:

```java
int i = 5;
do
{
    System.out.println(i);
} while(i < 3);
```

Output:

```
5
```

> **do-while always runs at least once** 🔥

## 8. When to use which loop?

| Situation       | Use           |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| Count known     | for loop      |
| Condition based | while loop    |
| Must run once   | do-while loop |

---

## 9. Golden Rules (Easy Memory)

* **for** → count based
* **while** → condition based
* **do-while** → at least once

---

## 10. Common Beginner Mistakes

* Forgetting increment/decrement
* Infinite loop (condition never becomes false)
* Wrong condition
* Using `=` instead of `==`
* Missing curly braces `{ }`

---

## Key Takeaways

* Loops help in **repetition and automation**
* Use **for** when count is known
* Use **while** when condition controls loop
* Use **do-while** when code must run once
* Dry run is the **best way to master loops**

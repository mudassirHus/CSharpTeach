# Day 4: Loops in Programming (for, while, do-while)

Loops are used to **repeat a block of code** multiple times until a condition becomes false.

**In simple words:**
  If you want to do something again and again → **use a loop** 🔁

---

## 1. What is a Loop?

A **loop** is a control structure that allows the program to execute the same code repeatedly based on a condition.

> A loop continues running **while the condition is true**.

---

## 2. Why do we need Loops?

We use loops to:

* Reduce code repetition
* Save time and effort
* Work with series of numbers
* Handle large data easily

Example:
Printing numbers from 1 to 100 without loop = writing 100 lines ❌
With loop = 3 lines ✅

---

## 3. Types of Loops (We use these 3)

1. **for loop**
2. **while loop**
3. **do-while loop**

---

# 4. for Loop

### Definition:

The **for loop** is used when we know **how many times** we want to repeat.

### Syntax:

```java
for(initialization; condition; update)
{
    // code to repeat
}
```

### Example:

```java
for(int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
{
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

### Trace (Dry Run):

| Step | i | i <= 3 | Print | i++ |
| ---- | - | ------ | ----- | --- |
| 1    | 1 | true   | 1     | 2   |
| 2    | 2 | true   | 2     | 3   |
| 3    | 3 | true   | 3     | 4   |
| 4    | 4 | false  | stop  |     |

### Explanation:

1. `int i = 1` → start
2. Check condition `i <= 3`
3. Print value
4. Increment i
5. Repeat until condition becomes false

Output:

```
1
2
3
```

---

# 5. while Loop

### Definition:

The **while loop** is used when repetition depends on a **condition**.

### Syntax:

```java
initialization;
while(condition)
{
    // code to repeat
    update;
}
```

### Example:

```java
int i = 1;
while(i <= 3)
{
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

### Trace (Dry Run):

| Step | i | i <= 3 | Print | i++ |
| ---- | - | ------ | ----- | --- |
| 1    | 1 | true   | 1     | 2   |
| 2    | 2 | true   | 2     | 3   |
| 3    | 3 | true   | 3     | 4   |
| 4    | 4 | false  | stop  |     |

### Explanation:

* Condition is checked first
* If true → code runs
* After code, i is incremented
* Loop continues until condition becomes false

Output:

```
1
2
3
```

---

# 6. do-while Loop

### Definition:

The **do-while loop** runs **at least once**, even if the condition is false.

### Syntax:

```java
initialization;
do
{
    // code to repeat
    update;
} while(condition);
```

### Example:

```java
int i = 1;
do
{
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while(i <= 3);
```

### Trace (Dry Run):

| Step | i | Print | i++ | i <= 3 |
| ---- | - | ----- | --- | ------ |
| 1    | 1 | 1     | 2   | true   |
| 2    | 2 | 2     | 3   | true   |
| 3    | 3 | 3     | 4   | false  |

### Explanation:

* Code executes first
* Then condition is checked
* Even if condition is false, loop runs once

Output:

```
1
2
3
```

---

## 7. Key Difference: while vs do-while

### while example:

```java
int i = 5;
while(i < 3)
{
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

Output: **No output** (condition false, loop not entered)

---

### do-while example:

```java
int i = 5;
do
{
    System.out.println(i);
} while(i < 3);
```

Output:

```
5
```

> **do-while always runs at least once** 🔥

---

## 8. When to use which loop?

| Situation       | Use           |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| Count known     | for loop      |
| Condition based | while loop    |
| Must run once   | do-while loop |

---

## 9. Nested Loops

### What is a Nested Loop?

A **nested loop** is a loop **inside another loop**.

👉 Outer loop controls **rows**
👉 Inner loop controls **columns**

Used mostly for:

* Patterns
* Tables
* Matrix programs

---

### Syntax:

```java
for(initialization; condition; update)
{
    for(initialization; condition; update)
    {
        // inner loop code
    }
}
```

---

### Example: Simple Nested Loop

```java
for(int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
{
    for(int j = 1; j <= 2; j++)
    {
        System.out.println("i = " + i + " j = " + j);
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
i = 1 j = 1
i = 1 j = 2
i = 2 j = 1
i = 2 j = 2
i = 3 j = 1
i = 3 j = 2
```

---

### Trace (Dry Run Logic):

* i = 1 → j runs from 1 to 2
* i = 2 → j runs from 1 to 2
* i = 3 → j runs from 1 to 2

👉 Inner loop completes fully for each outer loop cycle

---

### Pattern Example:

```java
for(int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
{
    for(int j = 1; j <= 3; j++)
    {
        System.out.print("* ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

### Output:

```
* * *
* * *
* * *
```

---

## 10. Golden Rules (Easy Memory)

* Outer loop → rows
* Inner loop → columns
* Inner loop finishes completely before outer increments

---

* **for** → count based
* **while** → condition based
* **do-while** → at least once

---

## 10. Infinite Loop (Very Important)

### What is an Infinite Loop?

An **infinite loop** is a loop that **never stops running** because the condition never becomes false.

This usually happens when:

* Increment/decrement is missing
* Condition is always true

### Example (Wrong Code):

```java
int i = 1;
while(i <= 5)
{
    System.out.println(i);
    // i++ is missing
}
```

👉 This will run forever 😵

### Correct Code:

```java
int i = 1;
while(i <= 5)
{
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

---

## 11. Common Beginner Mistakes

* Forgetting increment/decrement
* Writing wrong condition
* Using `=` instead of `==`
* Missing curly braces `{ }`
* Creating infinite loops by mistake
* Putting semicolon after while: `while(condition);` ❌

---

## 12. break Statement

### Definition:

`break` is used to **stop the loop immediately**.

### Example:

```java
for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
{
    if(i == 5)
    {
        break;
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

Output:

```
1
2
3
4
```

---

## 13. continue Statement

### Definition:

`continue` is used to **skip the current iteration** and move to next.

### Example:

```java
for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
{
    if(i == 3)
    {
        continue;
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

Output:

```
1
2
4
5
```

---

## 14. Loop Control Flow (How loop moves)

1. Initialization
2. Condition check
3. Execute code
4. Increment/Decrement
5. Repeat

---

## 15. Best Practices for Beginners

* Always check your condition
* Always ensure loop moves towards stop
* Dry run in your head
* Use meaningful variable names
* Avoid very complex conditions

---

## 16. Interview Tip

> If interviewer asks: "Why infinite loop happens?"

Answer:
"Because loop condition never becomes false due to missing or wrong increment/decrement."

---

## Key Takeaways

* Infinite loops are dangerous

* `break` stops the loop

* `continue` skips one iteration

* Condition + movement = safe loop

* Always dry run your loops

* Forgetting increment/decrement

* Infinite loop (condition never becomes false)

* Wrong condition

* Using `=` instead of `==`

* Missing curly braces `{ }`

---

## Key Takeaways

* Loops help in **repetition and automation**
* Use **for** when count is known
* Use **while** when condition controls loop
* Use **do-while** when code must run once
* Dry run is the **best way to master loops**

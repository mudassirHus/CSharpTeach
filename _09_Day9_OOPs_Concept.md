# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C# — Complete Theory

## 1. What is OOP?

**OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** is a programming approach where software is designed using **objects that represent real-world entities**.

Instead of writing long step-by-step instructions, OOP organizes code into meaningful objects like:
- Student  
- Car  
- BankAccount  
- Employee  
- Mobile  

Each object contains:
- Its own data  
- Its own behavior  

This makes programs structured and easy to manage.

## 2. Why OOP Was Introduced?

Before OOP, programmers used **procedural programming** (functions + variables only).

When software became large (banking systems, operating systems, websites), problems started.

### Problems in Procedural Programming
- Code became very long and messy  
- Hard to understand large programs  
- Difficult to maintain  
- Low reusability  
- One change could affect whole program  
- Hard for multiple developers to work together  

So a better way to organize programs was needed.  
That solution became **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

## 3. Basic Idea Behind OOP

OOP:

> Break a big problem into small manageable objects.

Each object:
- Represents something real  
- Has its own responsibility  
- Works independently  
- Can interact with other objects  

This makes software:
- Organized  
- Easy to debug  
- Easy to expand  
- Easy to maintain  

---

## 4. Real-World Thinking in OOP

OOP follows real-life thinking.

Example: College system  
We naturally think about:
- Student  
- Teacher  
- Course  
- Exam  

Each becomes an object in program.

This makes OOP logical and natural.

## 5. Basic Terminologies in OOP

### Class
A class is a blueprint or design.

Example:
- Blueprint of house = Class  
- Actual house = Object  

Class defines:
- Data (properties)
- Behavior (methods)

But class itself is just a design, not real.

---

### Object
An object is a real instance created from a class.

Example:
- Class = Car  
- Objects = BMW, Audi, Honda  

Objects actually exist and use memory.

---

### Properties (Data)
Properties store information about object.

Example:

**Student**
- Name
- Age
- Marks

**Car**
- Color
- Model
- Speed

---

### Methods (Behavior)
Methods are actions performed by object.

Example:

**Car**
- Start
- Stop
- Drive

**Student**
- Study
- Write exam
- Attend class

## 6. Goals of OOP

OOP was created to achieve:

- Modularity (divide program into parts)  
- Reusability (use code again)  
- Maintainability (easy to fix/update)  
- Security (protect data)  
- Scalability (program can grow easily)  

---
## 7. Why OOP Became So Popular?

### 1. Handles Large Projects
Used in:
- Banking systems
- Social media
- Games
- Enterprise software

Large systems need structure → OOP provides it.

---

### 2. Code Reusability
Once you create a model (like Employee or Student),  
you can reuse it many times.

Saves time and effort.

---

### 3. Easy Debugging
If an error occurs, check only that object  
instead of whole program.

---

### 4. Teamwork Friendly
In companies:
- One developer works on login
- One on payment
- One on dashboard

OOP allows dividing work easily.

---

### 5. Real-World Mapping
Software becomes similar to real-world systems.  
This makes development easier and logical.

---

## 8. Procedural Programming vs OOP

### Procedural Programming
- Focus on functions  
- Step-by-step instructions  
- Hard for large programs  
- Less secure  
- Difficult maintenance  

### Object-Oriented Programming
- Focus on objects  
- Real-world modeling  
- More secure  
- Easy maintenance  
- Best for large applications  

Modern software mostly uses OOP.

## 9. Why C# Strongly Uses OOP

C# was created by Microsoft to build:

- Windows applications  
- Web applications  
- Enterprise software  
- Game development (Unity)  
- Business systems  

Such systems require:
- Security  
- Structure  
- Reusability  
- Team development  

OOP supports all these.  
So C# is designed as a strongly object-oriented language.

Almost everything in C# revolves around objects.

---

## 10. Where OOP is Used in Real Life?

OOP is used everywhere:

### Banking Applications
- Account
- Customer
- Transaction

### Games
- Player
- Enemy
- Weapon
- Level

### Shopping Apps
- Product
- Cart
- Order
- User

### Mobile Apps
- Screen
- Settings
- User data

### Company Software
- Employee
- Salary
- Department

Every big system uses OOP.
